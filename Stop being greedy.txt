Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Y'all been eating long enough now, stop being greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touching, so don't make me wait
Fuck around, and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo
Ain't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen (what?)
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's having dreams
Or nightmares, the light dares to desert me (what?)
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me (what?)
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever (uh)
The closest thing to me is gon' get it, but never
Will I kill? I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holding on 'til what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhunting motherfuckas, stay on the floor
Four-four, that's what I get sick with (grr)
Four more, now all this is liquid (grr)
Y'all been eating long enough now, stop being greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touching, so don't make me wait
Fuck around, and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eating long enough now, stop being greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touching, so don't make me wait
Fuck around, and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
I thank the Lord every day that I'm blessed with the gift
I'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk past the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dawgs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start running (c'mon)
'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm coming (c'mon)
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money, give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm drunk, so I'ma bash his head wide open
Begging me to stop, but at least he died hoping
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowing red eyes, everything else is black
Y'all been eating long enough now, stop being greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touching, so don't make me wait
Fuck around, and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eating long enough now, stop being greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touching, so don't make me wait
Fuck around, and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners-up are thanking me for their health
Hoping that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's going down, you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops
One drops, then another and another
Gun pops, going through you and your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight 'cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga, when it's your time to go, you go
Y'all been eating long enough now, stop being greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touching, so don't make me wait
Fuck around, and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eating long enough now, stop being greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touching, so don't make me wait
Fuck around, and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eating long enough now, stop being greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touching, so don't make me wait
Fuck around, and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
Y'all been eating long enough now, stop being greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touching, so don't make me wait
Fuck around, and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate
